A CLI tool for creating TypeScript projects.

## Installation

You can install this CLI tool globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g its-ts
```

## Usage

Create a new TypeScript project:

```bash
its-ts create <projectName>
```

By default, the CLI will copy a template project and install its dependencies. You can use the `-f` or `--force` flag to overwrite an existing project with the same name.

## Example

Create a new TypeScript project named "my-ts-project":

```bash
its-ts create my-ts-project
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd my-ts-project
```

Start the project:

```bash
npm start
```
